Not a University-Sponsored Project: "Just to be crystal clear, we are not NTU. We don't have a giant lion statue, and our email addresses don't end in @ntu.edu.sg. This is just a bunch of students trying to help other students. Our collective intelligence is a powerful force, but it's not officially endorsed by any dean, department head, or even the guy who runs the campus coffee cart."

User-Generated Content: "All the info here is generated by fellow students. Think of it as a bunch of friends whispering advice in your ear—some of it is genius, and some of it might be slightly embellished (looking at you, person who said their professor can read minds). Use your best judgment, and maybe do a little extra research. We are not liable for any bad grades, misplaced hopes, or late-night existential crises caused by our course reviews."

Respect Copyright and Personal Space: "Please don't upload any copyrighted materials like your professor's secret lecture slides or the answers to the final exam. Also, no personal attacks! We're here to critique courses, not people. Keep it classy, people. The internet is forever, and your future self will thank you for not posting that angry rant at 3 a.m. about your TA."


Rule #1: Be a Good Human: "No personal attacks, no harassment, no weird stuff. This is a safe space for people to vent about their workload and get good advice. Let's keep it that way."

Rule #2: Be Honest, But Not a Troll: "Share your honest experiences, but remember there’s a difference between a helpful critique and a mean-spirited roast. We're here to help, not to burn bridges."

Rule #3: Don't Share Secrets: "This isn't the place to share confidential information. Think of it as a public library, not a private diary. If it belongs to someone else or is meant to be a secret, don't post it."

Rule #4: Have Fun! "Seriously. We're all in this together. Let's make this a helpful and enjoyable resource for everyone."
